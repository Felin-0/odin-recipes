        <h2>Description</h2>
          <p>Chapatis or ‘chapos’ as we call em in our part of the world – the awesome part of the world, are a perfect partner to stews and curries as well as grilled meats. They’re great for breakfast – fry an egg, add grated carrots, sliced onions, peppers and wrap in a chapati – The Ugandans call this a ‘Rolex” LOVE IT! So if you make chapatis and by chance some are left, you know what to make the next day 😉</p>
